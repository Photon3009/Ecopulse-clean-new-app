## Overview

This is a News App built with Flutter following the principles of Clean Architecture. It utilizes the Bloc state management pattern for a clear separation of concerns and easy maintainability. The data is persisted locally using the Floor database, and network requests are handled by Retrofit. Dependency injection is managed with GetIt.
